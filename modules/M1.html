                    influenced your life choices? Share a specific story or moment that demonstrates their influence on
                    you. How do their characteristics, whether Eastern or Western, shape their personality and
                    interactions with others? Compare these traits to your own.</div>
                <div class="content">
                    The person who inspired me to take my current course which is Computer Science is my father. At a
                    very young age,
                    I was already fascinated with computers, but what truly stood out for me was how applications
                    or programs worked. My father saw that in me, seeing the passion for programming. He gave me all the
                    needs for
                    programming. knew this was the path I was going to take, becoming a software engineer.
                    <br></br>
                    A defining moment was when my father was still a college student, he didn't know what to take
                    between Engineering
                    or Nursing. His mother, would always suggest to take Nursing due to the family having tons of
                    Nurses. But in the
                    end, he chose Engineering because that's
                    what he loves. He picked what was his best for him. Now, relating to that story I had the same
                    problem. I also had
                    troubles picking on what course I would take. My family would tell me to do Medical Technology due
                    to it valuing harmony
                    and duty, while myself encouraged critical thinking and self expression which is Computer Science.
                    This tension resonated
                    with me, as I, too, grew up in a familial conflict where family expectations sometimes clashed with
                    personal aspirations.

            <div class="card">
                <div class="meta">Reflect on your daily habits, traditions, or beliefs. Identify one or two specific
                    practices that you think are influenced by Eastern or Western culture. How do these practices
                    reflect your identity? Have you ever struggled to reconcile these influences? Share a personal
                    experience that illustrates this.</div>
                <div class="content">
                    One daily habit influenced by Eastern culture is my practice of journaling and reflection,
                    which I adopted after learning about the Japanese concept of "Ikigai" (a reason for being) and the
                    importance of self-awareness in many Eastern philosophies. Every evening, I spend 10–15 minutes
                    writing about my day, my emotions, and my goals. This practice helps me stay grounded and mindful,
                    aligning with Eastern values of introspection and harmony. On the other hand, a Western-influenced
                    habit is my focus on goal-setting and productivity, inspired by the Western emphasis on
                    individual achievement and self-improvement. I use planners and apps to track tasks, a practice that
                    reflects my ambition and drive to succeed in a competitive academic environment.
                    <br></br>
                    These practices reflect my identity as someone who values both inner peace and external
                    accomplishment. The Eastern-inspired journaling helps me connect with my emotional and spiritual
                    self, while the Western-influenced productivity habits fuel my desire to grow and achieve. However,
                    I’ve often struggled to reconcile these influences. For example, during my senior high school days, I
                    became so focused on achieving "With Honors" that I neglected my mental health and relationships. 
                    I stopped journaling, feeling it was a "waste of time" compared to studying. This led to burnout and a 
                    sense of emptiness, as if I was losing touch with my core self.
                    <br></br>
                    A turning point came during a conversation with my mother, who grew up in a traditional Filipino
                    household. She noticed my stress and reminded me somewhat similar to what a Confucian would say: 
                    "The superior man is modest in his speech but exceeds in his actions." She encouraged me to reconnect
                    with my journaling practice, emphasizing that true success comes from balance, not just achievement. 
                    I took her advice and restarted my reflection habit, which helped me regain perspective and prioritize self-care
                    alongside my goals. This experience taught me that my identity is not about choosing between Eastern
                    or Western influences but about integrating them in a way that honors both my roots and my
                    aspirations.

            <div class="card">
                <div class="meta">Think about a situation where you encountered cultural differences, either in school,
                    at home, or in your community. How did you respond to those differences, and what did you learn?
                    Based on this experience, how can you use your role as a student or future professional to promote
                    understanding and empathy? Provide at least one concrete action you can take within your field.
                </div>
                <div class="content">
                    During my senior year in high school, I encountered cultural differences in a group project with classmates from
                    diverse backgrounds. One team member, a student from a collectivist culture, prioritized group harmony and often
                    avoided voicing disagreements during discussions. In contrast, another member, from an individualist culture,
                    was direct and assertive, sometimes coming across as dismissive of others’ ideas. Initially, I felt frustrated
                    by the lack of "progress" in our meetings, as I was favored to a more direct, Western-style approach to
                    problem-solving.
                    <br></br>
                    My response evolved over time. At first, I tried to push the group to make quicker decisions, which only
                    heightened tensions. However, after observing the dynamics, I realized that the collectivist team member had
                    valuable insights but needed a safe space to express them. I began to facilitate discussions by explicitly
                    inviting everyone to share their thoughts and summarizing points to ensure all voices were heard. This approach
                    helped bridge the gap between the two perspectives and allowed us to complete the project successfully.
                    <br></br>
                    From this experience, I learned that cultural differences are not obstacles but opportunities for growth if
                    approached with empathy and curiosity. I also realized that effective communication requires adaptability and a
                    willingness to step outside one’s own cultural framework.
                    <br></br>
                    As a student and future professional in Computer Science, I plan to promote understanding and empathy by integrating
                    cultural awareness into technology design and development. A concrete action I can take is to prioritize inclusive
                    design practices that consider the diverse needs and perspectives of users from various cultural backgrounds. For
                    example, I will actively research and incorporate cultural variation into user interfaces, ensuring that language,
                    symbols, and functionality are accessible and respectful across different cultures. Additionally, I will advocate for
                    diversity and inclusion initiatives in tech teams, pushing for representation that reflects the global user base of
                    technology products.
