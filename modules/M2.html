                <div class="meta">Think of a defining moment in your life that shaped your current beliefs about how to
                    live. What happened, and what did you learn from it? If you had to express your philosophy in a
                    single sentence, what would it be? Can you relate it to any of the philosophers discussed in class,
                    not just in theory but in how you apply it to your life?</div>
                <div class="content">
                    A defining moment in my life occurred during a volunteer trip to a rural community in high school. I
                    was tasked with teaching basic computer skills to children who had limited access to technology. On
                    the first day, I arrived with a structured lesson plan, assuming it would be a straightforward task.
                    However, I quickly realized that the children were more interested in playing games than learning
                    about software. Frustrated, I tried to enforce my agenda, but their disengagement only grew. It
                    wasn’t until I stepped back and asked them what they wanted to learn that the atmosphere shifted.
                    We ended up co-creating a lesson that combined gaming with coding basics, and their enthusiasm
                    soared.
                    <br></br>
                    From this experience, I learned that true impact comes from meeting people where they are, not
                    imposing my own expectations onto them. This moment shaped my belief in the importance of
                    adaptability, empathy, and collaboration in achieving meaningful outcomes. If I had to express my
                    philosophy in a single sentence, it would be: Listen deeply, adapt willingly, and co-create
                    authentically.
                    <br></br>
                    This aligns with Aristotle’s concept of eudaimonia—the idea that flourishing comes from living
                    virtuously, not just avoiding pain. Like Aristotle, I’ve learned that suffering isn’t meaningless;
                    it’s a signal of what we care about. If I’m anxious about a project, it’s because I value
                    creativity. If I’m heartbroken, it’s because I valued love. The goal isn’t to eliminate pain but to
                    redirect it toward growth.

                    Dear Future Self,
                    <br></br>
                    As I write this, I’m 20 years old, sitting in my bedroom, trying to make sense of the
                    world and my place in it. I’m a curious person, driven by a desire to understand the complexities of
                    human identity and how technology can either bridge or widen the gaps between us. My personality is
                    a mix of idealism and pragmatism—I dream big but also obsess over the details. My strengths lie in
                    my ability to connect with people from different backgrounds and my persistence in solving problems,
                    even when they feel invicible. However, I struggle with self-doubt and the fear of not living
                    up to my own expectations. I’m also learning to balance my ambition with self-care, something I
                    often neglect in the pursuit of my goals.
                    <br></br>
                    My dreams today are to build technology that empowers people, to travel and immerse myself in
                    cultures different from my own, and to maintain deep, meaningful relationships. I want to be someone
                    who leaves a positive mark on the world, not through grand gestures, but through consistent,
                    thoughtful actions.
                    <br></br>
                    Here’s the advice I’d like you to remember:
                    <br></br>
                    1. Stay curious, but also humble. The world is vast, and no matter how much you learn, there
                    will always be more to discover. Don’t let knowledge make you rigid; let it make you more open.
                    <br></br>
                    2. Prioritize people over productivity. Relationships are the bedrock of a fulfilling life.
                    Don’t sacrifice them for career success or fleeting achievements.
                    <br></br>
                    3. Embrace failure as a teacher. Every mistake is an opportunity to grow. Don’t let fear of
                    failure keep you from taking risks.
                    <br></br>
                    4. Hold onto your values, but be willing to evolve. The person you are today is not the person
                    you’ll be in ten years, and that’s a good thing. Let your core values guide you, but allow yourself
                    to adapt as you learn and experience more.
                    <br></br>
                    5. Find joy in the small things. Life isn’t just about the big milestones; it’s the everyday
                    moments that make it rich. Don’t overlook them.
                    <br></br>
                    I hope that by the time you read this, you’ve stayed true to the person I am today—someone who cares
                    deeply, works passionately, and strives to make a difference. But more than anything, I hope you’ve
                    found peace in the journey, not just in the destination.
                    <br></br>
                    With love and hope,
                    <br></br>
                    Your 20-year-old self
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <div class="meta">Assess your real self and idea self. Are they aligned or different? If different, what
                    personal habits, decisions, or mindset shifts could help bridge the gap? Share a real-life
                    experience that illustrates your growth in this aspect.</div>
                <div class="content">
                    When I assess my real self and ideal self, I see both alignment and areas of discrepancy. My
                    real self is someone who is curious, empathetic, and driven by a desire to create meaningful
                    change, particularly through technology. I enjoy learning, collaborating with others, and tackling
                    challenges that have a social impact. However, I often struggle with perfectionism, self-doubt, and
                    a tendency to overcommit, which can lead to burnout.
                    <br></br>
                    My ideal self, on the other hand, is someone who embodies balance—someone who is not only
                    productive but also present, who prioritizes mental and physical well-being, and who leads with
                    confidence and clarity. This version of me is less afraid of failure, more consistent in self-care,
                    and better at setting boundaries.
                    <br></br>
                    The gap between these two selves is most evident in how I manage my time and energy. For example, I
                    often say “yes” to too many projects or social commitments, leaving little room for rest or
                    reflection. This misalignment was particularly clear during my senior high when I took on two
                    clubs, and one part-time job. I was physically and emotionally exhausted, and my work quality suffered. 
                    I realized I was chasing an image of productivity rather than focusing on what truly mattered.
                    <br></br>
                    To bridge this gap, I’ve started implementing the following habits and mindset shifts:
                    <br></br>
                    1. Prioritizing intentionality over busyness. I now ask myself, “Does this align with my values
                    and long-term goals?” before taking on new commitments.
                    <br></br>
                    2. Practicing self-compassion. I’m learning to treat myself with the same kindness I’d offer a
                    friend, especially when I fall short of my own expectations.
                    <br></br>
                    3. Scheduling downtime. I block off time in my calendar for rest, hobbies, and reflection,
                    treating it as non-negotiable.
                    <br></br>
                    4. Embracing imperfection. I’m gradually letting go of the need to do everything perfectly,
                    focusing instead on progress and effort.
                    <br></br>
                    A real-life experience that illustrates my growth in this area was when I recently turned down a
                    leadership role in a league management. While it was a great opportunity, I knew it would stretch
                    me too thin and distract me from my studies and personal well-being. Instead, I offered to
                    mentor a friend of mine for the role, which allowed me to contribute without overextending myself.
                    This decision felt like a step toward aligning my real self with my ideal self—someone who leads
                    with intention, not just ambition.
                    <br></br>
                    The journey isn’t linear, but I’m learning that bridging the gap between who I am and who I want to
                    be requires honesty, flexibility, and self-compassion.
