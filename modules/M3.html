                <div class="meta">Which people, groups, or social institutions have had a significant impact on how you
                    see yourself? How have these interactions shaped your understanding of your identity?</div>
                <div class="content">
                    Several people, groups, and social institutions have significantly shaped how I see myself, each
                    contributing to my understanding of my identity in unique ways.
                    <br></br>
                    Growing up in a trditional Filipino household, my family has been a cornerstone of my identity. They
                    taught me to value both tradition and innovation, collectivism and individualism. For instance, 
                    my mother’s emphasis on academic excellence instilled in me a strong work ethic, while my father’s 
                    encouragement to question norms helped me develop critical thinking. These influences often made me 
                    feel like a bridge between two worlds, shaping my identity as someone who navigates boundaries.
                    <br></br>
                    Social Media and Platforms influenced my professional identity as a com-sci student. They’ve connected me 
                    with mentors, peers, and projects that have expanded my skills and ambitions. However, they’ve also
                    challenged me to balance my online persona with my authentic self, especially when curating a
                    portfolio.
                    <br></br>
                    These interactions have collectively taught me that identity is not static but a dynamic interplay
                    of personal, cultural, and institutional influences. I’ve come to see myself as a multifaceted
                    individual.

            <div class="card">
                <div class="meta">How do you think others perceive you? What qualities, behaviors, or characteristics do
                    you believe people associate with you?</div>
                <div class="content">
                    I believe others perceive me as curious and driven, though this likely varies depending on the context of 
                    our relationship. Here’s how I think different groups might describe me.
                    <br></br>
                    Peers and classmates probably see me as collaborative and reliable. I’m often the
                    one organizing meetings or helping troubleshoot code during projects. My tendency to ask
                    questions and seek input might also make me appear curious or even slightly indecisive at times,
                    as I like to consider multiple perspectives before forming an opinion.
                    <br></br>
                    My friends likely see me as loyal and empathetic, someone who listens actively and
                    tries to support them through challenges. My humor and willingness to try new things might also make me 
                    appear adventurous and fun-loving.
                    <br></br>
                    To my family, I’m probably responsible but sometimes too hard on myself. They
                    appreciate my dedication to my studies and goals but often remind me to slow down and enjoy the
                    process.
                    <br></br>
                    However, I’m aware that there’s a gap between how I’d like to be perceived and how I might actually
                    come across. For example, while I strive to be confident, my self-doubt sometimes manifests as
                    hesitation or over-explanation, which could be misinterpreted as uncertainty. Similarly, my drive to
                    be helpful can sometimes make me appear overly accommodating, as I struggle to say no to
                    requests.

            <div class="card">
                <div class="meta">To gain a more objective view, ask a few people how they actually perceive you. What
                    insights did they share? How does their perception compare to your assumptions?</div>
                <div class="content">
                    To gain a more objective view of how others perceive me, I asked three people from different areas
                    of my life for their honest feedback: a close friend and a classmate. Their insights
                    were both affirming and surprising, offering a clearer picture of how I’m seen by others.
                    <br></br>
                    My close friend described me as “a loyal and thoughtful person who’s always there to
                    listen, but sometimes too hard on yourself.” She noted that I’m fun to be around because of my
                    curiosity and willingness to try new things, but she also pointed out that I tend to downplay my
                    achievements and internalize stress, which can make me seem distant or overly self-critical.
                    This aligned with my self-perception but also highlighted how my insecurities can affect my
                    relationships.
                    <br></br>
                    My classmate said I’m “super reliable and great at explaining complex ideas, but sometimes
                    overthink things.” He appreciated how I’m always willing to help with assignments or group
                    projects, but he also mentioned that I can be hesitant to make quick decisions, which he finds a
                    bit frustrating at times. This mirrored my awareness of being thorough but also revealed how my
                    desire for perfection can slow down progress.
                    <br></br>
                    Comparing their perceptions to my assumptions, I found both alignment and gaps. I was right in
                    thinking that others see me as curious, reliable, and empathetic, but I was surprised by how
                    noticeable my self-doubt and tendency to overcommit are to others. For example, I didn’t realize how
                    often I downplay my achievements or how my hesitation in decision-making can be perceived as
                    indecisiveness.
                    <br></br>
                    This task was an eye-opening. It confirmed that while I’m on the right track in many ways, there
                    are areas where my internal struggles are more visible than I thought. It’s motivated me to work on
                    self-compassion and boundary-setting, ensuring that my actions and attitudes reflect not
                    just my strengths, but also the person I’m striving to become.

            <div class="card">
                <div class="meta">Based on your reflections from the previous sections, how would you describe the
                    process of forming your self-concept? What patterns or insights did you notice about how your
                    identity is shaped by both internal and external influences?</div>
                <div class="content">
                    The process of forming my self-concept has been a dynamic interplay between internal reflection
                    and external feedback, shaped by experiences, relationships, and cultural contexts. Reflecting
                    on the previous sections, I’ve noticed several patterns and insights about how my identity is
                    constructed.
                    <br></br>
                    My self-concept is not a single, fixed idea but a mosaic of roles and
                    traits—I’m a son, a student, a technologist, and a friend. These identities are
                    not separate but interconnected, influencing one another in complex ways.
                    <br></br>
                    There’s often a tension between how I see myself and how
                    others perceive me. While I strive to be confident and balanced, others sometimes see me as
                    hesitant or overstretched. This gap highlights areas for growth, such as managing self-doubt
                    and setting boundaries. It also reminds me that self-awareness is an ongoing process, requiring both
                    introspection and openness to external perspectives.
                    <br></br>
                    The people around me have been instrumental in shaping my identity. Their feedback, whether explicit 
                    or implicit, has helped me refine my strengths and confront my weaknesses.
                    <br></br>
                    Overall, the process of forming my self-concept feels like a dialogue—between my internal
                    aspirations and external realities, between who I am and who I want to be. It’s a journey of
                    discovery, adaptation, and integration, where my identity is continually shaped by the interplay of
                    personal reflection and social interaction.
