                <div class="meta">How would you describe your political self? What political values and beliefs do you
                    consider central to your identity, and why?</div>
                <div class="content">
                    I would describe my political self as progressive and pragmatic, rooted in values of equality,
                    justice, and compassion. I believe in policies that promote social and economic equity, protect
                    human rights, and address systemic inequalities. Central to my identity is the conviction that
                    government should serve as a force for good, ensuring that everyone has access to basic needs like
                    healthcare, education, and opportunity. I also prioritize environmental sustainability, recognizing
                    that our actions today will shape the world for future generations. These beliefs stem from my
                    upbringing, where I was taught to value fairness and empathy, as well as my experiences witnessing
                    the impact of inequality on individuals and communities.

                <div class="content">
                    The institution that has most significantly influenced my political beliefs is school. In high
                    school, my history classes and school comelec exposed me to the principles of democracy. A turning
                    point was a class debate on healthcare
                    reform, where I researched the disparities in access to medical care. This experience opened my eyes
                    to the ways systemic issues affect people’s lives and solidified my belief in the importance of
                    policies that address these gaps. My teachers also encouraged critical thinking, pushing me to
                    question assumptions and consider multiple perspectives, which shaped my approach to politics.

                <div class="meta">Reflecting on your political socialization, have your political beliefs changed over
                    time? What experiences or factors prompted these changes?</div>
                <div class="content">
                    Yes, my political beliefs have evolved, particularly as I’ve gained more life experience and
                    exposure to diverse viewpoints. For example, I used to hold a more idealistic view of politics,
                    believing that solutions were straightforward if only people had the will to implement them.
                    I realized that change often requires compromise and incremental
                    steps, rather than all-or-nothing approaches. This shift has made me more appreciative of the
                    nuances of political issues and the importance of collaboration across ideological lines.

                <div class="content">
                    I define my spiritual self as secular yet deeply reflective, grounded in a belief in the inherent
                    goodness of people and the interconnectedness of all life. While I follow Catholicism,
                    I find meaning and purpose in practices like mindfulness, gratitude, and acts of kindness. I believe
                    in living with intention, striving to leave the world better than I found it, and finding beauty in
                    the ordinary moments of life. My spirituality is less about dogma and more about cultivating inner
                    peace and outer compassion.

                <div class="content">
                    Spirituality plays a significant role in my identity and decision-making by providing a moral
                    compass and a sense of perspective. For example, during a difficult decision about whether to pursue
                    a part-time job that would require relocating, I took time to reflect on my values and
                    priorities. My spiritual practice of mindfulness helped me recognize that while the opportunity was
                    appealing, it would come at the cost of my relationships and well-being. Ultimately, I chose to
                    stay, prioritizing balance and connection over ambition. This decision felt aligned with my deeper
                    sense of purpose.

                <div class="content">
                    My spiritual identity has been most strongly shaped by personal experiences and nature. Growing up,
                    family trips instilled in me a sense of awe and reverence for the
                    natural world. These experiences taught me to find peace and clarity in solitude and to see myself
                    as part of something larger than my individual existence. A specific moment that deepened this
                    connection was a solo trip during a stressful period in college. Being surrounded by the quiet
                    beauty of nature helped me regain perspective and reminded me of the resilience of life. This
                    experience reinforced my belief in the healing power of nature and its role in my spiritual
                    practice.

                <div class="content">
                    My spiritual beliefs provide me with resilience, gratitude, and a sense of purpose during difficult
                    times. For instance, when I faced rejection from a program I had set my heart on, I felt
                    disappointed and unsure of my path. Turning to my practice of mindfulness and journaling, I
                    reflected on the lessons the experience offered—patience, adaptability, and the importance of not
                    defining my worth by external outcomes. This process helped me reframe the rejection as an
                    opportunity for growth rather than a failure. My spiritual values also reminded me to be grateful
                    for the support of friends and family, which gave me the strength to move forward with hope.
