                <div class="meta">How do you view and appreciate your physical self, and what personal commitments can
                    you make to care for and respect your body?</div>
                <div class="content">
                    My view of my physical self has evolved significantly over the years, shifting from a place of
                    self-criticism to one of appreciation and respect. Growing up, I often compared myself to others,
                    focusing on what I perceived as flaws rather than strengths. I remember feeling frustrated with my
                    lack of athleticism in high school, or wishing I could change certain features to fit an ideal
                    I’d seen in media or among peers. It wasn’t until college, when I began to prioritize my well-being
                    over external expectations, that my perspective started to change.
                    <br></br>
                    Now, I see my body not as an object to be perfected, but as a tool and a partner—one that
                    allows me to experience the world, pursue my passions, and connect with others. I’ve come to
                    appreciate its resilience and capability. Whether it’s staying up late to debug a piece of
                    code, or simply carrying me through a busy day, my body has
                    proven itself to be remarkably adaptable. I’m grateful for the ways it enables me to engage with
                    life—my hands for typing and creating, my legs for exploring, and my senses for savoring art,
                    nature, and food.
                    <br></br>
                    That said, I’ve not always treated my body with the care it deserves. In the past, I’ve prioritized
                    productivity over rest, skipped meals during busy periods, and neglected physical activity when
                    stressed. These habits have taken a toll, leaving me feeling drained and disconnected from my body.
                    I recall a particularly intense semester when I pulled multiple all-nighters, subsisted on caffeine
                    and snacks, and ignored my body’s pleas for rest. By the end, I felt physically and emotionally
                    depleted, a stark reminder that my body is not a machine but a living entity that requires
                    nurturing.
                    <br></br>
                    Moving forward, I’m committed to honoring my physical self with intentional care and respect. This
                    means prioritizing sleep, not as a luxury but as a necessity, recognizing that rest is essential for
                    both my physical and mental health. It means moving my body regularly, whether through jogging,
                    or a simple walk, not to change its appearance but to celebrate its strength and vitality. It
                    means eating mindfully, focusing on nourishing my body with balanced meals and listening to its
                    hunger cues, rather than treating food as an afterthought.
                    <br></br>
                    I also want to practice gratitude for my body, taking a moment each day to appreciate what it allows
                    me to do, rather than fixating on how it looks. This shift in mindset is crucial—it’s about valuing
                    function over form, resilience over perfection. Lastly, I’m committed to listening to my body,
                    paying attention to its signals of fatigue or stress, and responding with rest or self-care, rather
                    than pushing through.
                    <br></br>
                    By embracing these practices, I hope to cultivate a relationship with my physical self that is
                    rooted in respect, gratitude, and care. After all, my body is not just a vessel for my ambitions
                    but a vital part of who I am—and it deserves to be treated as such.

            <div class="card">
                <div class="meta">How do you understand your sexuality, sexual orientation, and gender identity, and how
                    do these aspects shape your sense of self?</div>
                <div class="content">
                    My understanding of my sexuality, sexual orientation, and gender identity has been a deeply personal
                    and evolving journey, one that has significantly shaped my sense of self. I identify as a
                    heterosexual male, and while these labels provide a framework for understanding myself, I’ve
                    come to see them as just one part of a complex identity.
                    <br></br>
                    Growing up, I never questioned my sexual orientation—it felt innate and straightforward. However, as
                    I’ve grown older and more self-aware, I’ve begun to appreciate the nuances of sexuality and gender
                    beyond binary categories. I’ve learned to respect and admire the diversity of human experience,
                    recognizing that everyone’s journey is unique. This awareness has made me more empathetic and
                    open-minded, both in how I view others and how I understand myself.
                    <br></br>
                    My sexuality and gender identity have influenced my sense of self in several ways. As a heterosexual
                    man, I’ve often felt pressure to conform to traditional masculine norms—being strong, assertive, and
                    emotionally stoic. While some of these traits come naturally to me, others feel restrictive. For
                    example, I’ve had to unlearn the idea that showing vulnerability or seeking emotional support is a
                    sign of weakness. Instead, I’ve come to see these acts as essential to my well-being and
                    authenticity.
                    <br></br>
                    At the same time, my identity has also given me a sense of belonging and connection. It’s allowed me
                    to form deep, meaningful relationships with others, both romantic and platonic, and to find
                    community with people who share similar experiences. These connections have been a source of joy,
                    support, and personal growth.
                    <br></br>
                    However, I’m also aware of the privilege that comes with my identity. As a  man, I’ve
                    never had to face the discrimination or challenges that many LGBTQ+ individuals endure. This
                    awareness has deepened my commitment to being an ally, advocating for equality, and creating spaces
                    where everyone feels seen and valued, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
                    <br></br>
                    Ultimately, my sexuality and gender identity are integral to who I am, but they don’t define me
                    entirely. They are threads in the tapestry of my identity, woven together with my values,
                    experiences, and relationships. Embracing these aspects of myself has allowed me to live more
                    authentically, with greater empathy and understanding for both myself and others.

                <div class="meta">What are your thoughts and personal stands on the issues of body shaming, gender-based
                    violence, and discrimination? How do these issues affect individuals and society as a whole?</div>
                <div class="content">
                    The issues of body shaming, gender-based violence, and discrimination are deeply
                    troubling and reflect broader societal problems that affect individuals and communities on a
                    profound level. Personally, I stand firmly against these injustices, believing that every person
                    deserves to be treated with dignity, respect, and equality, regardless of their body type, gender,
                    or identity.
                    <br></br>
                    Body shaming is something I find particularly harmful because it attacks individuals at their
                    core, often targeting aspects of their appearance that are beyond their control. I’ve seen how
                    comments about weight, skin color, or physical features can erode a person’s self-esteem and mental
                    health. It’s a form of bullying that perpetuates unrealistic beauty standards and fosters a culture
                    of comparison and self-criticism. I believe everyone has the right to feel comfortable in their own
                    skin, and body shaming undermines that fundamental right. It’s a reminder that words have power, and
                    we must use them to uplift, not to tear down.
                    <br></br>
                    Gender-based violence is a pervasive issue that disproportionately affects women, non-binary
                    individuals, and other marginalized groups. Whether it’s physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, this
                    violence is a stark manifestation of power imbalances and toxic gender norms. I’ve witnessed how it
                    can trap individuals in cycles of fear and trauma, limiting their ability to live freely and fully.
                    On a societal level, it perpetuates inequality, normalizes aggression, and undermines the safety and
                    well-being of entire communities. I believe it’s everyone’s responsibility to challenge the
                    attitudes and systems that enable this violence, and to support survivors with compassion and
                    action.
                    <br></br>
                    Discrimination, in all its forms, is a barrier to justice and human flourishing. Whether based
                    on gender, race, sexuality, or ability, discrimination creates divisions and denies people
                    opportunities to thrive. I’ve seen how it can exclude individuals from education, employment, and
                    social spaces, reinforcing cycles of poverty and marginalization. It’s not just an individual issue
                    but a systemic one, rooted in historical biases and institutional practices. I believe we must
                    actively work to dismantle these systems, advocating for policies and cultures that promote
                    inclusivity and equity.
                    <br></br>
                    These issues are interconnected, each reinforcing the other in a cycle of harm. Body shaming often
                    targets those already marginalized by gender or racial discrimination, while gender-based violence
                    is frequently enabled by discriminatory attitudes and practices. Together, they create a society
                    where many people feel unsafe, undervalued, and unseen.
                    <br></br>
                    On a personal level, I’m committed to being part of the solution. This means educating myself about
                    these issues, speaking out against injustice when I see it, and supporting organizations that work
                    to create change. It also means examining my own biases and behaviors, ensuring that I’m not
                    inadvertently contributing to the problem. I believe that by standing against body shaming,
                    gender-based violence, and discrimination, we can move toward a more just and compassionate
                    society—one where everyone has the opportunity to live with dignity and respect.

                <div class="meta">In what ways can you promote respect for gender equality and human dignity in your
                    personal life, community, or future profession?</div>
                <div class="content">
                    Promoting respect for gender equality and human dignity is a commitment I take seriously,
                    and I believe there are tangible ways to embody these values in my personal life, community, and
                    future profession. Here’s how I plan to contribute:
                    <br></br>
                    I aim to be a vocal advocate for equality, starting with my own behavior
                    and relationships. This means actively challenging sexist remarks or stereotypes when I hear them,
                    even if it feels uncomfortable. It also involves supporting friends and family members who face
                    discrimination, whether by listening to their experiences or standing with them in moments of
                    injustice. I’m committed to educating myself about gender issues, recognizing that my understanding
                    is always evolving, and staying informed allows me to be a better ally.
                    <br></br>
                    I want to engage in initiatives that foster inclusivity and empowerment. This
                    could involve volunteering with organizations that support survivors of gender-based violence,
                    mentoring young people to encourage equitable attitudes, or participating in awareness campaigns
                    that highlight the importance of gender equality. I also believe in using my skills as a computer
                    scientist to create technology that amplifies marginalized voices or addresses gender disparities,
                    such as developing apps that promote safety or platforms that connect women in STEM.
                    <br></br>
                    I’m dedicated to building a workplace culture that values diversity and
                    ensures equal opportunities for all. This means advocating for fair hiring practices, equal pay, and
                    policies that support work-life balance, particularly for parents and caregivers. I also plan to
                    push for inclusive design principles in the technology I create, ensuring that products are
                    accessible and beneficial to people of all genders. Additionally, I’ll use my position to mentor and
                    sponsor women and non-binary individuals in tech, helping to break down barriers and create pathways
                    for their success.
                    <br></br>
                    On a broader scale, I believe in using my voice and platform to amplify the stories and struggles of
                    those who are often overlooked. Whether through social media, public speaking, or writing, I want to
                    raise awareness about gender inequality and human rights issues, encouraging others to join the
                    conversation and take action.
                    <br></br>
                    Ultimately, promoting gender equality and human dignity isn’t a one-time effort but a lifelong
                    practice. It requires intentionality, humility, and a willingness to listen and learn. By
                    integrating these values into my daily actions and long-term goals, I hope to contribute to a more
                    just and equitable world—one where everyone, regardless of gender, is treated with the respect and
                    dignity they deserve.
